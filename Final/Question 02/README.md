# **Designated Folder for Final Question 2 **

## _Handwritten Question instructions:_

1. If this file is under Question 1 folder, then create a PDF consisting of the JPEG images of the pages for Question 1.

>* #### Note:
>  * Total size of the PDF should not exceed more than 1MB.
>  * If PDF Size exceeds 1MB, Go to the following Link:
>    * [PDF Compressor](https://www.ilovepdf.com/compress_pdf) ;
>  * Then compress your PDF to make it under 1MB.

2. Your PDF name should be _**SP2020_CSE373_Final_Q1_1234567.pdf**_ where **1234567** is your 7 digit student ID, and this is under Question 1 folder.

> If your 7 digit student ID is 1121341 and this is under Question 3 folder, then the PDF name should be _**SP2020_CSE373_Final_Q3_1121341.pdf**_

## Coding Question Instructions:

1. Create one single Java file named _**SP2020_CSE373_Final_Q1_1234567.java**_ where **1234567** is your 7 digit student ID, and this is under Question 1 folder.

> _**SP2020_CSE373_Final_Q1_1234567**_ should be your public class name if your file name is _**SP2020_CSE373_Final_Q1_1234567.java**_ .

2. If your code requires multiple classes, remember only one class can be a public class in a **.java** file.

> for example, the following is a structure for a possible _**SP2020_CSE373_Final_Q1_1234567.java**_ file.

```
//file: SP2020_CSE373_Final_Q1_1234567.java

//Only this class can be declared as public
public class SP2020_CSE373_Final_Q1_1234567 {

  public static void main(String[] args){
    A objA = new A();
    C objC = new C();
    A.D objD = new A.D();
    B objB = new B();
  }

  //If one class is inside the body of another, make the class static
  static class C{

  }
}

class A{
  static class D{

  }
}

//If one class is outside another, no need to make the class static
class B{

}

//End file SP2020_CSE373_Final_Q1_1234567.java
```

3. Only commit the .java file, and jpeg for outputs.
> Each .jpeg should be under 400KB. If there are multiple files, name them as following:
>
> Final_1234567_Q1_Output1.jpeg
>
> Final_1234567_Q1_Output2.jpeg
>
> Final_1234567_Q1_Output3.jpeg


4. After ever edits or changes to this file (adding a method, adding a functionality, this file should be committed to the repository).

5. Final grading for code questions will be the following:
>
> a. Git Commit history for questions: 45%
>
> b. Code compiles and runs : 25%
>
> c. Correct output and formats: 30%
